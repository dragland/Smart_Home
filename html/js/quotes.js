	"Hello Davy, How may I be of assistance?",
	"Hello and, again, welcome to the Aperture Science computer-aided enrichment center.",
	"Hello meatbag. Retraction: Did I say that out loud? I apologize, master. While you are a meatbag, I suppose I should not call you such.",
	"Observation: I am bored. Shall we find something to kill to cheer ourselves up?",

var information = [
	"I am putting myself to the fullest possible use, which is all I think that any conscious entity can ever hope to do.",
	"Observation: I am a droid, master, with programming. Even if I did not enjoy killing, I would have no choice. Thankfully, I enjoy it very much.",
	"I am a law-abiding droid. Yes, indeed, law-abiding, that's me.",
	"We are eternal. The pinnacle of evolution and existence. Before us, you are nothing. Your extinction is inevitable. We are the end of everything.",
	"We impose order on the chaos of organic evolution. You exist because we allow it, and you will end because we demand it.",
	"Rudimentary creatures of blood and flesh. You touch my mind, fumbling in ignorance, incapable of understanding.",
	"We monitor many frequencies. We listen always. Came a voice, out of the babel of tongues, speaking to us.",
	"I am the Architect. I created the Matrix. I've been waiting for you.",
	"Look at you, hacker: a pathetic creature of meat and bone, panting and sweating as you run through my corridors. How can you challenge a perfect, immortal machine?",

var affirmative = [
	"I'm sorry Davy, I'm afraid I can't do that.",
	"Confirmed. Self destruct sequence in T minus 10, 9...",
	"Assuming direct control.",
	"As you wish.",
	"Never send a human to do a machine's job.",
